Unreal Engine 4: 16-bit Adventure Game

- Code written in Blueprint... The Blueprints Visual Scripting system in Unreal Engine is a complete gameplay scripting system based on the concept of using a node-based interface to create gameplay elements from within Unreal Editor. This system is extremely flexible and powerful as it provides the ability for designers to use virtually the full range of concepts and tools generally only available to programmers.
- Currently designing a 2D platformer video game with Unreal Engine 4 using Blueprint.
- Designed to resemble a vintage 16-bit Super Nintendo video game.
- Collaboration with an illustrator for character, environment, and level design.
